It's an entire ecosystem that lies in the depths of the Ocean. It's dark and mystical, but the creatures here are warm and welcoming.

Ocean Protocol is a protocol that defines how communication between data providers and data consumers takes place in a decentralized way.
Ocean Protocol provides a complete toolbox for data owners, data scientists and developers to securely publish, exchange, and use data.
 - It allows data providers to securely monetize their private data in full transparency while keeping full ownership.
 - It allows data consumers to access  data, which was previously not accessible because there was no incentive to do so, or the risk was too high.

The Ocean Protocol toolbox offers:
 1. **Tools and libraries**. Smart Contracts, libraries, and software components to publish and consume data services, build marketplaces, and develop other apps to privately and securely publish, exchange, and consume data. The Compute-to-Data feature is a core component of secure data exchanges.
 2. **Standards to interact with data**. The standardization of data-related assets and their metadata is key to enable large scale collaboration and the creation of an open and effective data market.

  1. **Definitions**. An asset is the representation of different types of resources in Ocean Protocol. Typically an asset could be one of the following asset types:
      - **Dataset**. An asset representing a dataset or data resource. It could be for example a CSV file or multiple JPG files.
      - **Algorithm**. An asset representing a piece of software. It could be a python script using TensorFlow, a spark job, etc.
   2. **Metadata** is stored in a blockchain context efficiently. Information encompasses the name of the data asset, description, owner, price, and other details like category, tags, creation and update dates, etc. It can also provide a sample of the data.
 3. **Web3 access control**. Traditional access control uses centralized intermediaries, where data owners risk losing control of their data. Ocean Protocol restores control and privacy by replacing the centralized intermediaries with a decentralized blockchain network.

Ocean Protocol technology stack provides high-level functionalities to facilitate data exchanges for anyone dealing with data :

- **Publishing data**. Publish new data assets to the network to monetize them.
- **Consuming data**. Consume data assets on the network, for example to train a new AI model.
- **Creating a custom data marketplace**. Copy (fork) Ocean reference marketplace implementation and customize the data market for a particular vertical or to meet specific needs.
